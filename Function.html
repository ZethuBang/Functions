    <h1>What is a Function</h1>
    <p>In programming, a function is a modular unit of code designed to perform specific tasks.</p>
       

    <h1>Function Call</h1>
    <p>A function call is an expression containing the function name followed by the function call operator, () . If the function has been defined to receive parameters, the values that are to be sent into the function are listed inside the parentheses of the function call operator.</p>
    </p>
    
    <p>To create a function, you need to:

        define the type of data it will return;
        assign it a name;
        provide a block of instructions (body) within curly braces {...} to define its functionality.</p>
    <h1>Function Definition</h1>
    <p>Definition: A function is a sequence of commands that can be reused together later in a program. Functions name the sequence of commands and dictate what code is executed. Functions also allow for separation of code, so we can easily use it again throughout a program.
          }   </p>

    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <p></p><br>
        ExaVariables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.mple : let myName = 'Bangiso;<br>
        let x = 10; <br>
        const PI = 3.14; <br>
        var message = "Hello, World!";</p>

    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <p>Data is a set of values that represent measurements or observations. Statistics is the study of data, and it can be used to describe, predict, and infer from a dataset. There are two main data types: numerical and categorical. Numerical data is quantitative and can be represented by numbers.=
    
        <h1>Examples of data types</h1>  
        
        <p>Data types are divided into two groups:

            Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
            Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)
